        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Reuben sandwich is one of my family's fix-it-quick favorites. 
            They are really delicious and easy to make. I like to serve them with 
            big bowls of steaming vegetable soup and dill pickles on the side. 
            A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. 
            The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's 
            not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced corned beef, 
            Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or 
            Thousand Island dressing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Corned Beef</li>
            <li>Swiss Cheese</li>
            <li>Saurkraut</li>
            <li>Rye Bread</li>
            <li>Russian Dressing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief 
            overview of what you can expect when you make reuben sandwiches at home:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread the dressing on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Assemble the sandwiches. Butter the top of each sandwich.</li>
            <li>Place the sandwich butter-side down on the hot skillet or griddle.</li>
            <li>Butter the other side. Flip when the bottom slice is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Grill until both sides are golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
